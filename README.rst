puppet-homebrew
===============

A Puppet Module to install Homebrew and manage Homebrew packages on Mac OSX.
This module can install using either homebrew or brewcask, along with a
fallback mode which attempts both.

This module supports Puppet version 4 and greater running on Ruby version 1.8.3
and greater. Note that versions of Ruby from 2.0.x to 2.2.x may no longer be
supported by Homebrew. For Puppet 3 support, please pin to version 1.7.1.

On Intel Macs the module installs Homebrew from a pinned copy of the official
installer, upstream's ``HEAD`` having dropped x86_64 in September 2026. ``brew``
still works there, but Intel is a "Tier 3" platform and its bottles stop at
Sonoma: on a newer macOS, formulae build from source, which needs the compiler
installed by ``homebrew::compiler``.

puppet-homebrew is available on the `Puppet Forge`_.

Usage
-----

Installing Packages
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Use the Homebrew package provider like this:

.. code-block:: puppet

    class hightower::packages {
      pkglist = ['postgresql', 'nginx', 'git', 'tmux']

      package { $pkglist:
        ensure   => present,
        provider => brew,
      }
    }

The providers works as follows:

* ``provider => brew``: install using ``brew install <module>``. Do not use
  brewcask.
* ``provider => brewcask``: install using ``brew cask install <module>``. Only use
  brewcask.
* ``provider => homebrew``: attempt to install using ``brew install <module>``. On
  failure, use ``brew cask install <module>``

Tapping Repositories
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The recommended way to manage taps is the dedicated ``homebrew_tap`` type:

.. code-block:: puppet

    homebrew_tap { 'neovim/neovim':
      ensure => present,
    }

You can untap a repository by setting ensure to ``absent``.

To tap a private or non-GitHub repository, provide a custom git URL. The URL is
drift-corrected: if the tap's actual git remote no longer matches the declared
value, the remote is rewritten *in place* with ``brew tap --custom-remote``
(no destructive untap/re-tap, so the local clone is preserved).

.. code-block:: puppet

    homebrew_tap { 'mycompany/internal':
      ensure => present,
      url    => 'https://git.example.com/mycompany/homebrew-internal.git',
    }

Additional options are available for third-party taps:

.. code-block:: puppet

    homebrew_tap { 'mycompany/tools':
      ensure            => present,
      force_auto_update => true,  # git-pull the tap on every `brew update`
      trust             => true,  # `brew trust --tap` (see below)
      force             => true,  # `brew tap --force` (force-clone via the API)
    }

* ``force_auto_update`` — when ``true``, sets the tap's
  ``homebrew.forceautoupdate`` git config so Homebrew refreshes it on every
  ``brew update``; when ``false`` the setting is removed. (Homebrew dropped the
  ``brew tap --force-auto-update`` flag in 4.2.13, so this is managed via git
  config directly.)
* ``trust`` — runs ``brew trust --tap`` / ``brew untrust --tap``. Trusting a
  non-official tap is required to load its formulae, casks and commands once
  ``HOMEBREW_REQUIRE_TAP_TRUST`` is set (the default from Homebrew 6.0.0).
  Official ``homebrew/*`` taps are always trusted.

  Trust is applied **before** the clone: ``brew tap`` validates a new tap by
  loading its formulae and casks, which an untrusted tap refuses, and brew
  reports that as a syntax error before deleting the half-made clone::

      Refusing to load cask mycompany/tools/foo from untrusted tap mycompany/tools.
      Error: Cannot tap mycompany/tools: invalid syntax in tap!

  A tap containing casks therefore cannot be tapped at all without
  ``trust => true``.

  When ``url`` is set, trust is recorded against the **URL**: Homebrew matches a
  ``user/repo`` entry only against a tap on its canonical
  ``github.com/user/homebrew-repo`` remote, and cannot resolve the real remote
  before the clone. That URL must be spelled exactly as git records it — outside
  ``github.com``, ``gitlab.com`` and ``codeberg.org``, ``.../repo`` and
  ``.../repo.git`` are two distinct entries and only one matches the tap.

  Trust is also stored **per user**, in ``$HOME/.homebrew/trust.json`` of the
  account running ``brew`` — the ``$user`` this module installs Homebrew under,
  not ``root`` and not the logged-in one. A machine that works interactively can
  still fail under Puppet, and vice versa.

  Either trap yields a tap that is never trusted, which Homebrew reports no
  differently from a successful grant, so the provider re-reads
  ``brew tap-info`` and warns when the state disagrees with what was declared.

  Changing ``url`` moves the trust reference (Homebrew migrates an entry only on
  a git redirect) and clears the tap's ``homebrew.forceautoupdate``, so both are
  re-applied and the stale entry dropped. ``ensure => absent`` revokes trust as
  well when this resource declares it — ``brew untap`` leaves the store
  untouched, so the entry would otherwise outlive the tap.
* ``force`` — passes ``--force`` to ``brew tap`` (e.g. to force-clone
  ``homebrew/cask`` even though it is otherwise served from the JSON API) and to
  ``brew untap`` (to allow ``ensure => absent`` even while formulae or casks from
  the tap are still installed, which ``brew untap`` refuses by default).

If unspecified, ``force_auto_update`` and ``trust`` are left unmanaged.

Declaring an official tap that has since been merged or built into Homebrew
(e.g. ``homebrew/cask-fonts``, ``homebrew/cask-versions``, ``homebrew/bundle``,
``homebrew/services``) still works but emits a deprecation warning.

Because ``homebrew_tap`` is a native type, you can inspect the currently tapped
repositories with ``puppet resource homebrew_tap``, and enforce that *only* the
declared taps exist (untapping any others) with a resource purge:

.. code-block:: puppet

    resources { 'homebrew_tap': purge => true }

The legacy ``tap`` package provider is still supported for backwards
compatibility but is deprecated in favour of ``homebrew_tap``:

.. code-block:: puppet

    package { 'neovim/neovim':
      ensure   => present,
      provider => tap,
    }

Ordering Taps
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

When both tapping a repo and installing a package from that repository, it is
important to make sure the former happens first. This can be accomplished in a
few different ways: either by doing so on a per-package basis:

.. code-block:: puppet

    homebrew_tap { 'neovim/neovim':
      ensure => present,
    } ->
    package { 'neovim':
      ensure   => present,
      provider => homebrew,
    }

or by setting all taps to occur before all other usages of this package with
`Resource Collectors`_:

.. code-block:: puppet

    # pick whichever provider(s) are relevant
    Homebrew_tap <| |> -> Package <| provider == homebrew |>
    Homebrew_tap <| |> -> Package <| provider == brew |>
    Homebrew_tap <| |> -> Package <| provider == brewcask |>

Updating Taps
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Homebrew only auto-updates taps just before a ``brew install``/``upgrade``/``tap``
runs, and this module deliberately sets ``HOMEBREW_NO_AUTO_UPDATE=1`` on all of
its provider reads. On a converged machine where nothing is installed during a
run, the taps would therefore never be refreshed.

Enable ``manage_update`` to run ``brew update`` (which fetches every git tap,
official *and* third-party) in a dedicated, opt-in class. The run is guarded by a
timestamp marker so it fires **at most once per interval** — between intervals
the resource stays ``unchanged``, so there is no per-run ``changed`` churn:

.. code-block:: puppet

    class { 'homebrew':
      user             => 'homebrew',
      manage_update    => true,
      update_frequency => 86400,   # seconds; default is 24h
    }

The marker (``<brew_prefix>/var/homebrew/.puppet-last-brew-update``) is only
refreshed on a successful ``brew update``, so a transient (e.g. network) failure
is retried on the next run rather than silently skipped for the whole interval.

To guarantee taps are refreshed before your packages are (re)installed, order the
class ahead of the ``brew`` packages in your own profile:

.. code-block:: puppet

    Class['homebrew::update'] -> Package <| provider == brew |>

``manage_update`` defaults to ``false``; when left disabled the ``homebrew::update``
class is not declared and behaviour is unchanged.

Pinning Formulae
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Pin an installed formula so ``brew upgrade`` leaves it untouched, using the
native ``homebrew_pin`` type. The formula must already be installed:

.. code-block:: puppet

    package { 'postgresql@14':
      ensure   => present,
      provider => brew,
    }
    -> homebrew_pin { 'postgresql@14':
      ensure => present,
    }

Set ``ensure => absent`` to unpin.

Managing Services
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Manage ``brew services`` background daemons with the native ``homebrew_service``
type:

.. code-block:: puppet

    homebrew_service { 'postgresql@14':
      ensure  => running,   # or 'stopped'
      require => Package['postgresql@14'],
    }

Applying a Brewfile
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Apply a ``Brewfile`` declaratively with ``homebrew_bundle``. Idempotence is
delegated to ``brew bundle check``:

.. code-block:: puppet

    homebrew_bundle { '/Users/kevin/Brewfile':
      ensure => present,
    }

    # named form with an explicit path and pruning of unlisted packages
    homebrew_bundle { 'company-baseline':
      ensure  => present,
      path    => '/etc/homebrew/Brewfile',
      cleanup => true,
    }

Extra Environment Variables
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Besides ``github_token`` (which sets ``HOMEBREW_GITHUB_API_TOKEN``), arbitrary
``HOMEBREW_*`` variables can be set via the ``homebrew_environment`` hash. They are
written both to ``/etc/environment`` (kept for backwards compatibility, though macOS does
not read this file automatically) and to ``$HOME/.homebrew/brew.env``, which is the file
Homebrew (>= 4.1) natively reads on startup and the mechanism actually honored by ``brew``
invocations:

.. code-block:: puppet

    class { 'homebrew':
      user                 => 'kevin',
      homebrew_environment => {
        'HOMEBREW_NO_AUTO_UPDATE' => '1',
        'HOMEBREW_NO_ANALYTICS'   => '1',
      },
    }

By default, ``$HOME`` is assumed to be ``/Users/<user>``. If the Homebrew user has a
non-standard home directory, set it explicitly with ``user_home`` (note that ``brew.env``
is only written when ``homebrew_environment`` or ``github_token`` is also set, so
``user_home`` has no effect on its own):

.. code-block:: puppet

    class { 'homebrew':
      user                 => 'kevin',
      user_home            => '/opt/homes/kevin',
      homebrew_environment => {
        'HOMEBREW_NO_AUTO_UPDATE' => '1',
      },
    }

Installing Brew
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To install homebrew on a node (with a compiler already present!):

.. code-block:: puppet

    class { 'homebrew':
      user      => 'hightower',
      group     => 'developers',  # defaults to 'admin'
      multiuser => false,         # set to true to enable multiuser support for homebrew
    }

Installing homebrew as the root user is no longer supported (as of late 2016).
Please ensure you install brew as a standard (non-root) user.

Note that some users have reported confusion between the *puppet* user and the
*homebrew* user -- it is perfectly fine to run puppet as root, in fact this is
encouraged, but the homebrew user must be non-root (generally, the system's main
user account).

If you run puppet as a non-root user and set the ``homebrew::user`` to a
*different* non-root user, you may run into issues; namely, since this module
requires the puppet user act as the homebrew user, you may get a password
prompt on each run. This can be fixed by allowing the puppet user passwordless
sudo privileges to the homebrew user.

If you are looking for a multi-user installation, please be sure to set the
multi-user flag, eg.:

.. code-block:: puppet

    class { 'homebrew':
      user      => 'kevin',
      group     => 'all-users',
      multiuser => true,
    }

If no compiler is detected, this module will automatically install the Xcode
Command Line Tools via ``softwareupdate``. No additional configuration is
required:

.. code-block:: puppet

    class { 'homebrew':
      user => 'kevin',
    }

Alternatively, you can install the Command Line Tools from a DMG by providing
both a package name and source URL:

.. code-block:: puppet

    class { 'homebrew':
      user                       => 'kevin',
      command_line_tools_package => 'command_line_tools_for_xcode_os_x_lion_april_2013.dmg',
      command_line_tools_source  => 'http://devimages.apple.com/downloads/xcode/command_line_tools_for_xcode_os_x_lion_april_2013.dmg',
    }

Adding a Github Token
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Homebrew uses a Github token in your environment to make your experience better
by:

- Reducing the rate limit on ``brew search`` commands
- Letting you tap your private repositories
- Allowing you to upload Gists of brew installation errors

To enable this feature, you can include:

.. code-block:: puppet

    class { 'homebrew':
      user         => 'kevin',
      github_token => 'MyT0k3n!',
    }

Here's a link to `create a personal access token`_ for Github.
